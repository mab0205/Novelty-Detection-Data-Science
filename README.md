## Description
This project aims to develop a novelty detection system applied to sports news. Novelty detection is a machine learning task that identifies new content by comparing it to previously known information.


### üîú Tasks
1. **Novelty Detection**  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Identify `novel` and `non-novel` news articles by assessing the information in each target article relative to the source articles.

2. **System Development**  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Develop a system that uses the `source` folder to distinguish between `novel` and `non-novel` information in the new articles within the `target` folder. This involves creating a model that can reliably recognize new information based on content changes detected through `novelty detection algorithms`.

3. **Evaluation and Comparison**  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Compare the system's results with the `Document Level Annotation (DLA)` attribute in each target article to assess the model‚Äôs accuracy using the f1-score. This comparison will validate the system‚Äôs ability to label articles accurately as "novel" or "non-novel."

Each article has a `.txt` file with the content and an accompanying `.xml` file containing metadata such as title, publication date, publisher, and other event-related information.
