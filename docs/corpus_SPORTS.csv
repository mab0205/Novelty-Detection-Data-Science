Ronaldo, who picked up his fourth Ballon d’Or in December, also landed the first separate FIFA prize since world football’s governing body and France Football announced in September that they would be presenting two separate awards. The Best FIFA Men’s Player award is voted for by each of FIFA’s 211 nations comprising the national team captain, manager, a journalist from every FIFA nation, and fans registered on FIFA.com — each group holding 25 percent of electoral weight — for a player’s performances from Nov. 20, 2015 to Nov. 22, 2016. Five-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi shone as Barca won the 2015-16 La Liga title, but the Argentina international was upstaged this year by Ronaldo, who won both the UEFA Champions League with Real Madrid and Euro 2016 with Portugal in a stunning year. Ronaldo scored 61 goals and registered 20 assists in 60 games for club and country during voting period (48 goals in 47 games for Real Madrid; 13 in 13 games for Portugal), while Messi netted 59 goals, 34 assists in 64 games (51 goals in 53 games for Barcelona; eight in 11 games for Argentina) and lost in the Copa America final to Chile. France striker Griezmann finished as Euro 2016 top scorer and overall scored 41 goals and bagged 13 assists in 69 games (33 goals in 54 games for Atletico Madrid; eight in 15 games for France). First awarded in 1991, the FIFA Best Player award (then known as FIFA World Player of the Year) was merged with France Football’s Ballon d’Or from 2010 through 2015 — to become the FIFA Ballon d’Or — but France Football magazine announced new rule changes for its award last year and ended its six-year association with FIFA. Before the partnership with FIFA, the Ballon d’Or was given to the top European player from 1956 from 1994. And between 1995 and 2009, it was awarded to the best player from any continent playing at a European club. Since 2008, only Messi (one Ballon d’Or in 2009; four FIFA Ballon d’Ors in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2015) and Ronaldo (two Ballon d’Ors in 2008 and 2016; two FIFA Ballon d’Ors in 2013 and 2014) have been awarded either top prize. Orlando City’s Kaka, in 2007, was the last to pick it up outside the duo after guiding AC Milan to the Champions League that year.

SPTE002,SPTE002TGT058,"Italian Claudio Ranieri won the coach of the year award for leading outsiders Leicester City to the English Premier League title. 
The 31-year-old Ronaldo was rewarded for a year in which he won the Champions League with his club Real Madrid and then Euro 
2016 with Portugal. Argentine Messi was second in the vote and Frenchman Antoine Griezmann third. 
""I'm very happy and I can say that 2016 was the best year of my career,"" said Ronaldo as he was presented the award by FIFA president Gianni Infantino. 
Messi missed the ceremony along with all other Barcelona players who had been invited. 
""With the aim of prioritising preparations for Wednesday’s game against Athletic Club, FC Barcelona have decided that the players recognised in the awards will not be travelling to Switzerland for the ceremony,"" said the club in a statement. 
Ronaldo also won the France Football's Ballon d'Or, the other major international award for the sport, last month. 
Ronaldo also won the old FIFA award once in 2008 and also in 2013 and 2014 when it was organised jointly with France Football magazine.

SPTE002,SPTE002TGT004,"Cristiano Ronaldo's 2017 has begun like 2016 ended, with more silverware. 
The soccer superstar can now add ""The Best FIFA Men's Player 2016"" to his trophy cabinet, after a year in which he landed a double European triumph with club and country, as well as the prestigious Ballon d'Or Award. 
Ronaldo accepted FIFA's top prize at Monday's ceremony in Zurich, co-hosted by Hollywood actress Eva Longoria. 
He received 34.54% of the total vote to beat Barcelona and Argentina striker Lionel Messi (26.42%) and Antoine Griezmann (7.53%) of Atletico Madrid and France. 
The 31-year-old had a stellar 2016 -- and he called it ""the best of my career."" 
""I had a lot of doubts but the trophy showed that I lived up to that. After I won what I did, I had no doubts,"" he said. 
""It was a year that was magnificent on a personal level, on a sports level. I would like to thank very warmly everybody who voted for me. To the fans, to the other players, to the media: Thank you."" 
In May, Ronaldo scored the winning penalty for Real Madrid in the Champions League final to defeat city rival Atletico and secure the third European title of his career. 
Then as captain of Portugal's national team he lifted the Euro 2016 trophy after beating host France in the final. It was the first time Ronaldo had won a major honor with his country. 
Ronaldo scored 51 goals in club competitions last season as Real Madrid missed out on the La Liga title to Messi's Barcelona by a point. He's already scored 17 this campaign, as Zinedine Zidane's side has opened up a four-point lead in the Spanish title race and matched its arch rival's record of 39 domestic matches unbeaten. 
Messi, Ronaldo's perennial sparring partner when it comes to the top awards and a five-time Ballon d'Or winner, won a domestic league and cup double with Barcelona last season, scoring 51 goals in all competitions in the process. 
Griezmann was named the best player in the Spanish league last season, helping Atletico to third in La Liga, and to its second Champions League final in three years, this time losing to Real in a penalty shootout. 
The 25-year-old had a superb Euro 2016, helping France to the final by scoring a tournament-leading six goals and creating two, before he suffered heartbreak at the hands of Ronaldo again. 
However, unlike Ronaldo and Messi he was not picked in the FIFA awards' FIFPro World XI.Votes from supporters account for 25% of the award, and the same amount is allocated to members of the world's press. National team coaches and captains also contribute 25% of the voting each. 
FIFA had run its awards jointly with the Ballon d'Or for the past five years, but that agreement with France Football magazine has now ended and both organizations now have their own competitions. 
Full list of awards: 
Men's player: Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal). 
Women's player: Carli Lloyd (United States). 
Men's coach: Claudio Ranieri (Leicester City). 
Women's coach: Silvia Neid (Germany). 
FIFA Fair Play: Atletico Nacional (Colombia). 
FIFA Puskas best goal: Mohd Faiz Subri (Penang FA).

SPTE002,SPTE002TGT016,"Cristiano Ronaldo received FIFAâs best player award for the fourth time on Monday, after Portugal and Real Madrid won both major European titles in 2016. He beat runner-up and great rival Lionel Messi and Antoine Griezmann to complete a sweep of top individual awards.
â2016 was the best year of my career,â Ronaldo said in Portuguese in his acceptance speech, which he began by exclaiming âWow, wow, wow.â.
Ronaldo got 34.54 percent of total voting points in a 23-candidate ballot. Messi received 26.42 percent, and third-place Griezmann got 7.53 percent. Voting was by national team captains and coaches, selected media, and fans online.
Ronaldoâs fourth FIFA award closed the gap on five-time winner Messi, the runner-up to each Ronaldo victory, who did not attend the ceremony.
Ronaldoâs 2016 trophy haul included the European Championship, Champions League, and Club World Cup, plus individual best player awards from UEFA and France Football magazine.
Messiâs Barcelona won the Spanish league and cup double, though he captained Argentina to lose the Copa America final.
Griezmannâs France and Atletico Madrid lost both finals to Ronaldoâs teams.
Ronaldoâs coaches for club and country were beaten by Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri, who earned the menâs coaching prize for a stunning English Premier League title.
âWhat happened last year was something strange. The God of football said Leicester must win,â said Ranieri, who was in his first season at the unfashionable provincial club widely tipped for relegation.
Ranieri collected his trophy from Diego Maradona, who earlier Monday played in an exhibition match with other retired greats at FIFA headquarters.
Like Ronaldo, Carli Lloyd of the United States won a FIFA player prize for the second year in a row.
Lloyd won despite Germany midfielder Melanie Behringer playing on the Olympic gold medal-winning team. Five-time winner Marta was runner-up and Behringer was third.
âI honestly was not expecting this,â Lloyd said. âI know Melanie did fantastic in the 2016 Olympics.â
Germany did win the womenâs coaching prize as Silvia Neid earned her second FIFA prize, after also winning the 2010 award. Neid beat two previous winners: Pia Sundhage of Sweden, the Olympic silver medalist, and last yearâs winner, Jill Ellis of the United States.
The Puskas Award for best goal was won by Mohd Faiz Subri, who scored with a wildly swerving long-range free kick for Malaysian club Penang.
A playersâ vote organized by international union FIFPro gave a World XI of: Manuel Neuer (Germany, Bayern Munich); Dani Alves (Brazil, Barcelona/Juventus), Sergio Ramos (Spain, Real Madrid), Gerard Pique (Spain, Barcelona), Marcelo (Brazil, Real Madrid); Toni Kroos (Germany, Real Madrid), Andres Iniesta (Spain, Barcelona), Luka Modric (Croatia, Real Madrid); Messi, Luis Suarez (Uruguay, Barcelona), Ronaldo.
The First FIFA fan award was chosen by fans and was made to supporters of Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund, who joined in singing the English clubâs anthem âYouâll Never Walk Aloneâ before a Europa League quarterfinal. The other nominees were Iceland fans at Euro 2016, and Dutch club ADO Den Haag, whose fans brought soft toys to children supporting rival team Feyenoord.
FIFA made its Fair Play Award to Atletico Nacional, the Colombian club which was scheduled to host Chapecoense in the first leg of the Copa Sudamericana final on Nov. 30.
After most of the Brazilian team died in a plane crash flying to the match, Atletico Nacional asked the South American soccer confederation to present the title and trophy to Chapecoense.

The award comes one month after the 31-year-old also pipped Argentinian rival Messi to win his fourth Ballon d'Or title. 
Ronaldo said: ""I tell you 2016 was the best year of my career. I had a lot of doubts but the trophy I think shows I lived up to that. 
""After what I won and what I did I had no doubts that I would be able to get it, and to be able to have this achievement, it was a year that was magnificent on a personal level and a sports level. 
""I will never forget this wonderful year."" 
The award, voted for by a combination of national team captains and managers, journalists and fans, was inaugurated after FIFA ended its association with the Ballon d'Or last year. 
Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri won the coach of the year title in recognition for leading the Foxes to their improbable Premier League triumph. 
Ranieri, who beat Portugal coach Fernando Santos and Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane to win the prize, said: ""I think what happened in England last season was amazing, something strange. 
""My age is 65 and I start now to make a manager,"" he joked. 
Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund shared the fan award for their joint rendition of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" during their Europa League clash at Anfield in April last year. 
And the FIFA Fair Play Award went to Colombian club Atletico Nacional, who requested the 2016 Copa Sudamericana title be awarded to Chapecoense following their tragic plane crash en route to the final. 
Houston Dash midfielder Carli Lloyd was voted women's player of the year while Germany coach Silvia Neid pipped England-born United States manager Jill Ellis to the women's coach award. 
No Premier League players were voted into the FIFPro World XI, with Real Madrid leading the way with five representatives.

SPTE002,SPTE002TGT068,"Cristiano Ronaldo claimed Fifa's inaugural best player of the year award yesterday, the latest prize for the Real Madrid and Portugal star after a glittering 2016 for club and country. 
Leicester City's Claudio Ranieri received the best men's coach award following his side's fairytale Premier League triumph. 
But the night again belonged to the 31-year-old Ronaldo, who edged out long-time nemesis Lionel Messi for the trophy as well as France's Antoine Griezmann, the top player at this summer's European championship. 
Ronaldo had already won the Ballon d'Or after his third Champions League title, thanks largely to his 16 goals in 12 games, as well as triumphing with Portugal at Euro 2016 — the country's first major prize. 
“2016 was the best year of my career,” Ronaldo said after being handed the prize from Fifa President Gianni Infantino. 
Ranieri, 65, who saw off Real boss Zinedine Zidane and Portugal manager Fernando Santos, said the best coach honour was ""incredible"" after receiving the prize from Argentine football legend Diego Maradona. 
Under Ranieri's leadership, Leicester pulled off one of the greatest shocks in English football history by defying title odds of 5,000-1 to lift the Premier League trophy last season. 
Having miraculously avoided relegation the previous season, the Foxes rode that wave of momentum all the way to the title. 
The prizes were based on a combined voting process involving national team coaches and captains, a select group of journalists and fans. 
Ronaldo took 34.5 per cent of the vote over 26.4 per cent to Messi, who skipped the awards show co-hosted by US actress and former Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria. 
Barcelona said Messi was focused on preparing for an upcoming match against Athletic Bilbao. 
' Bittersweet ' 
US midfielder Carli Lloyd scooped the best women's player of 2016, the two-time Olympic gold medallist adding to her 2015 Fifa Women's World Player of the Year accolade. 
The American finished ahead of Brazilian star Marta and Germany's Melanie Behringer. 
She described 2016 as “bittersweet,” with the US failing to win a medal for the first time in women's Olympic football. 
Spain's La Liga accounted for nine of the 11 players in the FIFPro team of the year with Ronaldo and Messi headlining a star-studded line-up. 
Ronaldo was joined by Real team-mates Sergio Ramos, Marcelo, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric while the side comprised four Barcelona players with Gerard Pique, Andres Iniesta and Luis Suarez joining Messi. 
Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer — named to the FIFPro World 11 for the fourth year running — was the only player selected without links to Spain's top two clubs. 
Juventus defender Dani Alves was included for a sixth time having helped Barca to a league and cup double before leaving the Camp Nou for Italy last June. 
Fifa also gave a fair play prize to the Colombian side Atletico Nacional. 
The team had asked South America's football governing body to award a regional club title to Chapecoense after most of the Brazilian side perished in a plane crash on the way to the first leg of the final. 
World football's governing body launched the new award series after ending its six-year collaboration with France Football magazine for the Ballon d'Or. 
The change is one of many implemented under Infantino, who took over FIFA last year pledging to lead it away from the scandals that dominated the end of Sepp Blatter's tenure. 
Speaking on the so-called “green carpet” outside the Zurich awards venue, Maradona said the prizes helped define a new Fifa identity. 
“After everything that was taken away from football, everything that was tainted by corruption, to see new people, new faces, that provides me with hope,” Maradona said. 
But the first 11 months of Infantino's administration have had their troubles, including massive and often contentious Fifa staff overhauls and an ethics probe that ultimately cleared Infantino of abusing his office. 
Infantino's biggest test to date is set for today, when Fifa's powerful governing council will decide whether to back his controversial push to expand the World Cup to 48 teams from its current 32-nation format.

SPTE002,SPTE002TGT001,"Cristiano Ronaldo again. It seems that his success story opens the year of 2017 as he is the biggest favorite to be FIFA's World Best Player in the upcoming ceremony this Monday in Zurich. 
Last year, Ronaldo beat Messi to claim the Ballon d"" Or award for the fourth time. The Portuguese gained a series of success with club Real Madrid and the Portugal national team. The world football governing body FIFA terminated its cooperation with French Football magazine for the Ballon d"" Or award last year. They collaborated for six years. 
Besides Ronaldo, Lionel Messi (Argentina-Barcelona) and Antoine Griezmann (France-Atletico Madrid) were also nominated for the men's category. In a star-studded ceremony, US actress Eva Longoria will host the event, accompanied by German host Marco Schreyl, as Firstpost reported. 
Meanwhile, for the best coach category, Real Madrid's Zinedine Zidane will compete with Claudio Ranieri, who surprisingly brought Leicester City to win the Premier League in the 2015-2016 season, and Fernando Santos, who successfully lead Portugal to win its first international trophy at the 2016 EURO in France. 
Zidane was given a tremendous job to coach one of the world's best clubs after the sacking of Rafael Benitez, who is currently coaching Newcastle United. Zidane led El Real to dominate the European championship by winning the European Champions League in the 2015-2016 season. The success was followed by the European Super Cup and World Cup Club in Japan last year. 
However, the French legend modestly said that he didn't expect to win. 
Voting is carried out by national team captains and coaches and selected journalists. The good news is that the voting also involves an online poll of soccer fans for the first times, according to BBC report. 
Each category contributes to 25% of the points. 
As fans are the twelfth players, FIFA also gives the award for the best fans (besides the best player, coach, and goal). Liverpool and Dortmund fans singing""You'll Never Walk Alone"" before the start of the Europa League game at Anfield were included in the nomination list. 
Dortmund's former coach Jurgen Klopp is now a coach of Liverpool. Fans were showing a respect for the German coach, no matter where he is coaching now. 
The sympathetic act shown by supporters of Dutch club ADO Den Haag who brought toys for kid supporters of Eredivisie rival Feyenoord and Iceland supporters clapping to pay respect to players at the 2016 EURO were also put in a nomination list.

Sinclair chose Herdman as top coach, followed by Neid and Sundhage. Herdman chose Sundhage, followed by Neid and former South Africa coach Vera Pauw
Germany did win the women’s coaching prize as Silvia Neid earned her second FIFA prize, after also winning the 2010 award. Neid beat two previous winners: Pia Sundhage of Sweden, the Olympic silver medallist , and last year’s winner, Jill Ellis of the United States. The Puskas Award for best goal was won by Mohd Faiz Subri, who scored with a wildly swerving long-range free kick for Malaysian club Penang.

The First FIFA fan award was chosen by fans and was made to supporters of Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund, who joined in singing the English club’s anthem “You’ll Never Walk Alone” before a Europa League quarterfinal. The other nominees were Iceland fans at Euro 2016, and Dutch club ADO Den Haag, whose fans brought soft toys to children supporting rival team Feyenoord.
FIFA made its Fair Play Award to Atletico Nacional, the Colombian club which was scheduled to host Chapecoense in the first leg of the Copa Sudamericana final on Nov. 30.
After most of the Brazilian team died in a plane crash flying to the match, Atletico Nacional asked the South American soccer confederation to present the title and trophy to Chapecoense.

SPTE002,SPTE002TGT005,"Cristiano Ronaldo was named FIFA’s Best Men’s Player for 2016 on Monday night, beating Lionel Messi and Antoine Griezmann on the three-man shortlist to claim the prize in Zurich. 
Ronaldo, who picked up his fourth Ballon d’Or in December, also landed the first separate FIFA prize since world football’s governing body and France Football announced in September that they would be presenting two separate awards. 
FIFA’s Best Men’s Player award is voted for by each of FIFA’s 211 nations comprising the national team captain, manager, a journalist from every FIFA nation, and fans registered on FIFA.com — each group holding 25 percent of electoral weight — for a player’s performances from Nov. 20, 2015 to Nov. 22, 2016. 
Five-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi shone as Barca won the 2015-16 La Liga title, but the Argentina international was upstaged this year by Ronaldo, who won both the UEFA Champions League with Real Madrid and Euro 2016 with Portugal in a stunning year. 
Ronaldo scored 61 goals and registered 20 assists in 60 games for club and country during voting period (48 goals in 47 games for Real Madrid; 13 in 13 games for Portugal), while Messi netted 59 goals, 34 assists in 64 games (51 goals in 53 games for Barcelona; eight in 11 games for Argentina) and lost in the Copa America final to Chile. 
Despite France striker Griezmann finishing as Euro 2016 top scorer, he finished third for the trophy having scored 41 goals and bagged 13 assists in 69 games (33 goals in 54 games for Atletico Madrid; eight in 15 games for France.) 
Since 2008, only Messi (one Ballon d’Or in 2009; four FIFA Ballon d’Ors in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2015) and Ronaldo (two Ballon d’Ors in 2008 and 2016; two FIFA Ballon d’Ors in 2013 and 2014) have been awarded either top prize.

SPTE002,SPTE002TGT006,"Cristiano Ronaldo has been named The Best FIFA Football Player after a sensational 2016 which saw him secure a second Champions League crown with Real Madrid and lead Portugal to a historic European Championship triumph, The Daily Mail reports. 
The 31-year-old star on Monday, January 9 once again grabbed blagging rights over rival Lionel Messi, having picked up the prestigious Ballon d'Or award last month ahead of the Barcelona forward. 
Messi, who did not attend FIFA's The Best ceremony in Zurich due to Barcelona commitments, and Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann were both beaten by the Portuguese forward. 
The former Manchester United star was the overwhelming favourite after a stellar 12 months in which he won Euro 2016, the Champions League and the UEFA Super Cup. 
Ronaldo ended the year with 55 goals in 57 games for club and country but it was his success in the two big tournaments of the year that ultimately saw him claim the prize ahead of his rivals. 
He played a crucial role as Real beat city rivals Atletico Madrid in May to become European champions for a record-extending 11th time. 
Then two months later, Portugal triumphed at Euro 2016 in France to claim a major trophy for the first time — despite losing their captain to injury early on in the final against France. 
Also Monday, Claudio Ranieri was named FIFA's best men's coach of 2016, after leading Leicester City to a fairytale Premier League title triumph, AFP says. 
The Italian beat out France's Zinedine Zidane, who steered Real Madrid to Champions League glory in his first year as manager and Fernando Santos, the mastermind behind Portugal's Euro 2016 championship success.

Messi stayed away from the bash and Ronaldo finished his acceptance speech by saying he was 'sorry some people from Barcelona aren't here, but that's understandable'. 
Cristiano Ronaldo was named Player of the Year at FIFA's 'The Best' awards ceremony
Lionel Messi did not turn up to the event in Zurich as he prepares for a Copa del Rey game
England manager Gareth Southgate and captain Wayne Rooney both left Messi out of their choice of the world's top three players. 
Messi avoided the ceremony in Zurich despite finishing second to great rival Ronaldo in FIFA's new 'The Best' awards — which have been launched to rival the Ballon d'Or. 
Officially his club wanted him to concentrate on preparing for Wednesday night's Copa del Rey tie against Athletic Bilbao, but it's believed the Argentine simply did not want to play second fiddle to Real Madrid star Ronaldo. 
Messi scored 51 goals in the calendar year of 2016, but that still didn't put him in Southgate's top three — he voted instead for Chelsea's former Leicester midfielder N'Golo Kante and Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann, who finished third in the overall poll. 
Left to right: Luca Modric, Marcelo, Claudio Ranieri, Silvia Neid, Carli Lloyd and Ronaldo
Meanwhile, Rooney went for Ronaldo, Luis Suarez and Jamie Vardy, whose goals propelled Leicester to their 5,000-1 Premier League title. 
Messi himself snubbed Ronaldo by picking Barcelona team-mates Suarez, Neymar and Andres Iniesta, while Ronaldo did much the same thing by choosing Real Madrid's Gareth Bale, Luka Modric and Sergio Ramos. 
Leicester manager Ranieri was voted coach of the year and received his trophy plus a hug from Diego Maradona. 
Ranieri, chivalrous as ever, shook hands with the other two shortlisted candidates, Real Madrid's Champions League winning coach Zinedine Zidane and Portugal's European championship victor Fernando Santos. 
Ranieri said: 'I am crazy, very crazy. I want to thank my wife, my family, my agent, my players and the fans. I think what happened in England last season was something strange. The god of football said Leicester must win. My age is 65 but I'm only starting out as a manager.' 
Real Madrid superstar Ronaldo won a vote of his peers and beat Messi to top spot.

SPTE002,SPTE002TGT069,"Cristiano Ronaldo claimed FIFA’s inaugural best player of the year award on Monday, the latest prize for the Real Madrid and Portugal star after a glittering 2016 for club and country. 
Leicester City’s Claudio Ranieri received the best men’s coach award following his side’s fairytale Premier League triumph. 
But the night again belonged to the 31-year-old Ronaldo, who edged out long-time nemesis Lionel Messi for the trophy as well as France’s Antoine Griezmann, the top player at this summer’s European championship. 
Ronaldo had already won the Ballon d’Or after his third Champions League title, thanks largely to his 16 goals in 12 games, as well as triumphing with Portugal at Euro 2016 — the country’s first major prize. 
“2016 was the best year of my career,” Ronaldo said after being handed the prize from FIFA President Gianni Infantino. 
Ranieri, 65, who saw off Real boss Zinedine Zidane and Portugal manager Fernando Santos, said the best coach honour was “incredible” after receiving the prize from Argentine football legend Diego Maradona. 
Under Ranieri’s leadership, Leicester pulled off one of the greatest shocks in English football history by defying title odds of 5,000-1 to lift the Premier League trophy last season.  
Having miraculously avoided relegation the previous season, the Foxes rode that wave of momentum all the way to the title. 
The prizes were based on a combined voting process involving national team coaches and captains, a select group of journalists and fans. 
Ronaldo took 34.5 percent of the vote over 26.4 percent to Messi, who skipped the awards show co-hosted by US actress and former “Desperate Housewives” star Eva Longoria. 
Barcelona said Messi was focused on preparing for an upcoming match against Athletic Bilbao. 
US midfielder Carli Lloyd scooped the best women’s player of 2016, the two-time Olympic gold medallist adding to her 2015 FIFA Women’s World Player of the Year accolade. 
The American finished ahead of Brazilian star Marta and Germany’s Melanie Behringer. 
She described 2016 as “bittersweet”, with the US failing to win a medal for the first time in women’s Olympic football. 
Spain’s La Liga accounted for nine of the 11 players in the FIFPro team of the year with Ronaldo and Messi headlining a star-studded line-up. 
Ronaldo was joined by Real team-mates Sergio Ramos, Marcelo, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric while the side comprised four Barcelona players with Gerard Pique, Andres Iniesta and Luis Suarez joining Messi. 
Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer — named to the FIFPro World 11 for the fourth year running — was the only player selected without links to Spain’s top two clubs. 
Juventus defender Dani Alves was included for a sixth time having helped Barca to a league and cup double before leaving the Camp Nou for Italy last June. 
FIFA also gave a fair play prize to the Colombian side Atletico Nacional. 
The team had asked South America’s football governing body to award a regional club title to Chapecoense after most of the Brazilian side perished in a plane crash on the way to the first leg of the final. 
World football’s governing body launched the new award series after ending its six-year collaboration with France Football magazine for the Ballon d’Or. 
The change is one of many implemented under Infantino, who took over FIFA last year pledging to lead it away from the scandals that dominated the end of Sepp Blatter’s tenure. 
Speaking on the so-called “green carpet” outside the Zurich awards venue, Maradona said the prizes helped define a new FIFA identity. 
“After everything that was taken away from football, everything that was tainted by corruption, to see new people, new faces, that provides me with hope,” Maradona said. 
But the first 11 months of Infantino’s administration have had their troubles, including massive and often contentious FIFA staff overhauls and an ethics probe that ultimately cleared Infantino of abusing his office. 
Infantino’s biggest test to date is set for Tuesday, when FIFA’s powerful governing council will decide whether to back his controversial push to expand the World Cup to 48 teams from its current 32-nation format.

Germany did win the women's coaching prize as Silvia Neid earned her second FIFA prize, after also winning the 2010 award. Neid beat two previous winners: Pia Sundhage of Sweden, the Olympic silver medalist, and last year's winner, Jill Ellis of the United States.
The Puskas Award for best goal was won by Mohd Faiz Subri, who scored with a wildly swerving long-range free kick for Malaysian club Penang.
A players' vote organized by international union FIFPro gave a World XI of: Manuel Neuer (Germany, Bayern Munich); Dani Alves (Brazil, Barcelona/Juventus), Sergio Ramos (Spain, Real Madrid), Gerard Pique (Spain, Barcelona), Marcelo (Brazil, Real Madrid); Toni Kroos (Germany, Real Madrid), Andres Iniesta (Spain, Barcelona), Luka Modric (Croatia, Real Madrid); Messi, Luis Suarez (Uruguay, Barcelona), Ronaldo.
The First FIFA fan award was chosen by fans and was made to supporters of Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund, who joined in singing the English club's anthem ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" before a Europa League quarterfinal. The other nominees were Iceland fans at Euro 2016, and Dutch club ADO Den Haag, whose fans brought soft toys to children supporting rival team Feyenoord.
FIFA made its Fair Play Award to Atletico Nacional, the Colombian club which was scheduled to host Chapecoense in the first leg of the Copa Sudamericana final on Nov. 30.
After most of the Brazilian team died in a plane crash flying to the match, Atletico Nacional asked the South American soccer confederation to present the title and trophy to Chapecoense.

SPTE002,SPTE002TGT019,"Cristiano Ronaldo received FIFA's best player award for the fourth time on Monday, after Portugal and Real Madrid won both major European titles in 2016.
He beat runner-up and great rival Lionel Messi and Antoine Griezmann to complete a sweep of top individual awards.
''2016 was the best year of my career,'' Ronaldo said in Portuguese in his acceptance speech, which he began by exclaiming ''Wow, wow, wow.''
Ronaldo got 34.54 percent of total voting points in a 23-candidate ballot. Messi received 26.42 percent, and third-place Griezmann got 7.53 percent. Voting was by national team captains and coaches, selected media, and fans online.
Ronaldo's fourth FIFA award closed the gap on five-time winner Messi, the runner-up to each Ronaldo victory, who did not attend the ceremony.
Ronaldo's 2016 trophy haul included the European Championship, Champions League, and Club World Cup, plus individual best player awards from UEFA and France Football magazine.
Messi's Barcelona won the Spanish league and cup double, though he captained Argentina to lose the Copa America final.
Griezmann's France and Atletico Madrid lost both finals to Ronaldo's teams.
Ronaldo's coaches for club and country were beaten by Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri, who earned the men's coaching prize for a stunning English Premier League title.
''What happened last year was something strange. The God of football said Leicester must win,'' said Ranieri, who was in his first season at the unfashionable provincial club widely tipped for relegation.
Ranieri collected his trophy from Diego Maradona, who earlier Monday played in an exhibition match with other retired greats at FIFA headquarters.
Like Ronaldo, Carli Lloyd of the United States won a FIFA player prize for the second year in a row.
Lloyd won despite Germany midfielder Melanie Behringer playing on the Olympic gold medal-winning team. Five-time winner Marta was runner-up and Behringer was third.
''I honestly was not expecting this,'' Lloyd said. ''I know Melanie did fantastic in the 2016 Olympics.''
